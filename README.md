# US-STATES-GAME-DATA-ANALYTICS-USING-PYTHON
This is a mini project on basics of Data Analytics using the Pandas Library in Python.
<br>
This is also an Educational Project where children can interact with the Graphical User Interface of Turtle and learn all the 50 states of the United States of America
<br>
If the user enters "exit" then a .csv file is generated where all the states missed by the player is listed. This can be a great Educational tool for people
<br>
The project involves extensive data analysis using the Panda's Library of Python and the Turtle Module(Graphical User Interface) of Python
<br>
I have gathered all the data from https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/states. 
<br>
The Project also involves event handling and data manipulation using various data analysis techniques
